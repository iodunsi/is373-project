# Docker Guide 

VM - simulates the hardware (Linux) and creates an environment in which it can simulate it on your computer

Vertical scaling - increasing the speed of the computer in when scaling applications for more users

Horizontal scaling - 

Thread - stream of computation taking place between the application and the kernel

Orchestration software - orchestrates where containers run inside data centers, manages access to them
- must open network ports
- share data
- managing security, scaling, and operation of all containers

Jay Notes: 9/11/24

Application anything with UI sends code to Kernel which connects to hardware (cpu, memory, etc)

VM simulates hardware 

Docker does containerization â€¦ provide a fake kernel which real applications use

Vertical scaling (one cpu turned into a vm that runs with tons of speed) vs horizontal scaling (one cpu turned multiple VMs that allow for multiple nodes and allow for more responses to be handled, parrelization )

Container Orchestration software - orchestrates where the containers are running, it opens network ports, share data,

Docker guide should explain:
Docker Virtualization Containerization (Docker kubernetes (need 3 servers), what should student choose why?) explain kernels 
WSL 2 
MAC?? How to run ubuntu (oracle virtualbox)
