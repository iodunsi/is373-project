# How to Use CI-CD Pipeline within Github


## Initial Setup

In order to setup a CI/CD pipeline on Github, you must initialize it within the "Actions" tab in your repo.

You will be met with this screen. From there, click "Configure". Then, there will be a file with a basic workflow file template and a .yml extension.

This is your workflow file, which is responsible for running your application continously as you edit, make changes, and push those changes to Github. You workflow file can also feature responsibilities such as logging into Docker, pushing images to Docker, running software tests, as well as installing dependencies.


# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)

The most basic definition of CI/CD is having you code being automatically tested and then automatically deployed.


* **Continous Integration:** is a process that occurs when a certian specified action occurs such as creating a pull request. In this process the code is complied, built (for various OS), and tested each time. If there's an error or a test failed, the code can't be merged.
    * One common misunderstanding is that the tests are created automatically too. However, this isn't the case. A devloper has to manually create the tests which then ran when each person tries to merge code. 

* **Continious Delivery:** is the process that occurs after the CI stage and the testing. In this the code is ecesnially ready to deploy on click manually.
    * The benifit of this is that there is more control on what is ecensially put to production. It also can allow for the code to be checked again manually. 
    * **Continious Deployment:** is similar to delivery, but in this case the code is automatically deployed without intervention. 

* **Benifits:** 
    * Deploying to be faster
    * Allows those who are working on the code to instantly know if the code is working or not via the tests and allow them to get to working on fixing it if there's an error. 
    * It allows smaller bugs to be easily seen in the CI process and then be deployed automantically in the CD process. 

* **GitHub Actions:** You might be wondering how to set it up, however it is made pretty simple by GitHub actions in which you can use a template to start or create your own .yml file that sets up the actions that trigger the CI/CD process and what exactly to do.
