**Docker** is a tool that performs containerization, allowing a user to easily run and manage many containers. 

## Key Terms:

* **Container:** A lightweight environment that holds the program code and files. 
    * It runs on the host computer using its kernel which manages the hardware (cpu, memory, etc) and bridges it to the software, 
    * This makes it isolated meaning it can't touch anything outside of itself. 

* **Docker Image:** A template that has everything the program needs from code to the dependencies it uses. 
    * This image is created from a dockerfile that holds instructions on how to set it up and says what to install
